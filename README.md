# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of sample projects that demonstrate my skills and expertise in data science and machine learning.
> Note, this is a work in progress and will evolve over time.
## Technologies Used

- **Polars**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: For data querying and management.
- **PySpark**: For big data processing and analytics.
- **Scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning algorithms.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning and neural network implementations.
- **PyTorch**: For dynamic computation and deep learning models.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plotting and visualisation.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Configuration for pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards.
- **.python-version**: Specifies the Python version for the project.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project.
- **pyproject.toml**: Project metadata and dependencies.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions used across the projects.
- **uv.lock**: Dependency lock file for reproducibility.

## MLOps Practices

I strive to follow best MLOps practices in my projects, including version control, reproducibility, and documentation. This ensures that my workflows are efficient and maintainable.
